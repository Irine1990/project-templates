    <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhiwas born on 2 October 1869 into a Gujarati Hindu Modh Bania family in Porbandar (also
        known as Sudamapuri), a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and then part of the small princely state of
        Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the British Raj. His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822–1885),
        served as the dewan (chief minister) of Porbandar state. His family originated from the then village of
        Kutiana in what was then Junagadh State</p>
    <p> Although he only had an elementary education and had previously been a clerk in the state administration,
        Karamchand proved a capable chief minister. During his tenure, he married four times. His first two wives died
        young, after each had given birth to a daughter, and his third marriage was childless. In 1857, he sought his
        third wife's permission to remarry; that year, he married Putlibai (1844–1891), who also came from Junagadh,
        and was from a Pranami Vaishnava family. Karamchand and Putlibai had three children over the ensuing decade:
        a son, Laxmidas (c. 1860–1914); a daughter, Raliatbehn (1862–1960); and another son, Karsandas (c. 1866–1913).
    </p>
    <p>On 2 October 1869, Putlibai gave birth to her last child, Mohandas, in a dark, windowless ground-floor room of
        the Gandhi family residence in Porbandar city. As a child, Gandhi was described by his sister Raliat as
        "restless as mercury, either playing or roaming about. One of his favourite pastimes was twisting dogs' ears."
        The Indian classics, especially the stories of Shravana and king Harishchandra, had a great impact on Gandhi in
        his childhood. In his autobiography, he states that they left an indelible impression on his mind. He writes:
        "It haunted me and I must have acted Harishchandra to myself times without number." Gandhi's early
        self-identification with truth and love as supreme values is traceable to these epic characters.</p>

    <h2 id="Chapter 2- Principles">Chapter 2- Principles</h2>
    <p>Gandhi grew up in a Hindu and Jain religious atmosphere in his native Gujarat, which were his primary influences,
        but he was also influenced by his personal reflections and literature of Hindu Bhakti saints, Advaita Vedanta,
        Islam, Buddhism, Christianity, and thinkers such as Tolstoy, Ruskin and Thoreau.At age 57 he declared himself to
        be Advaitist Hindu in his religious persuasion, but added that he supported Dvaitist viewpoints and religious
        pluralism.</p>

    <p>Gandhi was influenced by his devout Vaishnava Hindu mother, the regional Hindu temples and saint tradition which
        co-existed with Jain tradition in Gujarat.Historian R.B. Cribb states that Gandhi's thought evolved over time,
        with his early ideas becoming the core or scaffolding for his mature philosophy. He committed himself early to
        truthfulness, temperance, chastity, and vegetarianism.</p>

    <p> Gandhi's London lifestyle incorporated the values he had grown up with. When he returned to India in 1891, his
        outlook was parochial and he could not make a living as a lawyer. This challenged his belief that practicality
        and morality necessarily coincided. By moving in 1893 to South Africa he found a solution to this problem and
        developed the central concepts of his mature philosophy.</p>

    <p> According to Bhikhu Parekh, three books that influenced Gandhi most in South Africa were William Salter's
        Ethical Religion (1889); Henry David Thoreau's On the Duty of Civil Disobedience (1849); and Leo Tolstoy's The
        Kingdom of God Is Within You (1894). The art critic and critic of political economy John Ruskin inspired his
        decision to live an austere life on a commune, at first on the Phoenix Farm in Natal and then on the Tolstoy
        Farm just outside Johannesburg, South Africa. The most profound influence on Gandhi were those from Hinduism,
        Christianity and Jainism, states Parekh, with his thoughts "in harmony with the classical Indian traditions,
        specially the Advaita or monistic tradition".</p>

        The word Mahatma, while often mistaken for Gandhi's given name in the West, is taken from the Sanskrit words
        maha (meaning Great) and atma (meaning Soul). Rabindranath Tagore is said to have accorded the title to
        Gandhi. In his autobiography, Gandhi nevertheless explains that he never valued the title, and was often
        pained by it.</p>
    <p>
        Innumerable streets, roads and localities in India are named after Gandhi. These include M.G.Road (the main
        street of a number of Indian cities including Mumbai and Bangalore), Gandhi Market (near Sion, Mumbai) and
        Gandhinagar (the capital of the state of Gujarat, Gandhi's birthplace). Florian asteroid 120461 Gandhi was named
        in his honour in September 2020.In October 2022, a statue of Gandhi was installed in Astana on the embankment of
        the rowing canal, opposite the cult monument to the defenders of Kazakhstan.</p>

    <p>Gandhi was a prolific writer. His signature style was simple, precise, clear and as devoid of artificialities.
        One of Gandhi's earliest publications, Hind Swaraj, published in Gujarati in 1909, became "the intellectual
        blueprint" for India's independence movement. The book was translated into English the next year, with a
        copyright legend that read "No Rights Reserved".For decades he edited several newspapers including Harijan in
        Gujarati, in Hindi and in the English language; Indian Opinion while in South Africa and, Young India, in
        English, and Navajivan, a Gujarati monthly, on his return to India. Later, Navajivan was also published in
        Hindi. In addition, he wrote letters almost every day to individuals and newspapers.</p>

    <p>Gandhi also wrote several books including his autobiography, The Story of My Experiments with Truth (Gujarātī
        "સત્યના પ્રયોગો અથવા આત્મકથા"), of which he bought the entire first edition to make sure it was reprinted.] His
        other autobiographies included: Satyagraha in South Africa about his struggle there, Hind Swaraj or Indian Home
        Rule, a political pamphlet, and a paraphrase in Gujarati of John Ruskin's Unto This Last which was an early
        critique of political economy.This last essay can be considered his programme on economics. He also wrote
        extensively on vegetarianism, diet and health, religion, social reforms, etc. Gandhi usually wrote in Gujarati,
        though he also revised the Hindi and English translations of his books.</p>

    <p>At the request of Gopal Krishna Gokhale, conveyed to him by C. F. Andrews, Gandhi returned to India in 1915. He
        brought an international reputation as a leading Indian nationalist, theorist and community organiser.</p>

    <p>Gandhi joined the Indian National Congress and was introduced to Indian issues, politics and the Indian people
        primarily by Gokhale. Gokhale was a key leader of the Congress Party best known for his restraint and
        moderation, and his insistence on working inside the system. Gandhi took Gokhale's liberal approach based on
        British Whiggish traditions and transformed it to make it look Indian.</p>

    <p>Gandhi took leadership of the Congress in 1920 and began escalating demands until on 26 January 1930 the Indian
        National Congress declared the independence of India. The British did not recognise the declaration but
        negotiations ensued, with the Congress taking a role in provincial government in the late 1930s.</p>
    <p>Gandhi and the Congress withdrew their support of the Raj when the Viceroy declared war on Germany in September
        1939 without
        consultation. Tensions escalated until Gandhi demanded immediate independence in 1942 and the British responded
        by imprisoning him and tens of thousands of Congress leaders.</p>
    <p> Meanwhile, the Muslim League did co-operate with Britain and moved, against Gandhi's strong opposition, to
        demands for a totally separate Muslim state of Pakistan. In August 1947 the British partitioned the land with
        India and Pakistan each achieving independence on
        terms that Gandhi disapproved.</p>
